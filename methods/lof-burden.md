# Loss of function burden

The loss of function \(LoF\) burden was calculated per gene.

For each individual and gene, the number of variants with a loss of function First, variants that carry a loss of function were defined

To calculate the LoF burden per gene, first variants that carry a loss of function were defined. was calculated

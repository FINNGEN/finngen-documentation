# Loss of function burden

For every endpoint, we estimated the loss of function \(LoF\) burden of each gene.

First, we calculated the number of variants with a loss of function per individual and gene, yielding a $$n \times p$$ matrix \( $$n$$being the number of individuals and $$p $$ the number of genes\). 

Second, we used the new summarised variables as input in the SAIGE GWAS, replacing the genotype matrix that was used in the regular GWAS.

# Endpoints

The disease endpoints were defined using nationwide registries:

* [Drug purchase and  Drug Reimbursement](https://www.kela.fi/web/en/research-data-requests)
* [Digital and Population Data Services Agency](https://dvv.fi/en/population-information-system)
* [Statistics Finland](https://www.stat.fi/til/ksyyt/index_en.html)
* [Register of primary health care visits: AVOHILMO](https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/statistics/information-on-statistics/register-descriptions/register-of-primary-health-care-visits)
* [Care Register for Health Care: HILMO](https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en/statistics/information-on-statistics/register-descriptions/care-register-for-health-care)
* [Finnish cancer registry](https://syoparekisteri.fi/assets/files/2017/07/variable_list_eng_net.pdf)

We harmonized over the International Classification of Diseases \(ICD\) revisions 8, 9 and 10, cancer-specific ICD-O-3, \(NOMESCO\) procedure codes, Finnish-specific Social Insurance Institute \(KELA\) drug reimbursement codes and ATC-codes. 

These registries spanning decades were electronically linked to the cohort baseline data using the unique national personal identification numbers assigned to all Finnish citizens and residents. 

A full list of FinnGen endpoints is [available online](https://www.finngen.fi/en/researchers/clinical-endpoints) for release 2. 

The endpoints with fewer than 100 cases, near-duplicate endpoints, and developmental “helper” endpoints were excluded from the final PheWas \(column “OMIT”\).

Endpoints with N&lt;150 are not released by [THL](https://thl.fi/en/web/thlfi-en) \(Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare\).

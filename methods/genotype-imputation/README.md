# Genotypes

FinnGen individuals were [genotyped](genotype-data.md) with Illumina and Affymetrix chip arrays \(Illumina Inc., San Diego, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Santa Clara, CA, USA\).

Chip genotype data were [imputed](genotype-imputation.md) using the population-specific[ SISu v3 imputation reference panel](sisu-reference-panel.md) of 3,775 whole genomes.

Merged imputed genotype data is composed of 42 data sets that include samples from multiple cohorts.

Post-imputation QC involved excluding variants with imputation INFO &lt; 0.7.

* Total number of individuals: 146,630
* Total number of variants \(merged set\): 16,962,023
* Reference assembly: GRCh38/hg38

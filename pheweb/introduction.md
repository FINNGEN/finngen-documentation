# Getting started

The web browser [r2.finngen.fi](http://r2.finngen.fi/) contains all FinnGen GWAS results from release 2 and provides you with three options:

1. Search for the GWAS result of a [variant](variant-view.md), [phenotype](manhattanplot.md) or [gene](gene-view.md). 
2. Explore the loss-of-function burden \(LoF\) for gene-phenotypes combinations.
3. Find a particular phenotype/endpoint.
